👋 Hi, I’m Mohamed Menazaa

    👀 I’m interested in embedded systems, power electronics, and advanced control systems for industrial and automotive applications.
    🌱 As an Embedded Systems Engineer, I specialize in real-time systems, USB and advanced communication protocols, motor control, and signal processing. I work extensively with Zephyr RTOS, MATLAB/Simulink, and PCB design using Altium Designer.
    💼 I'm experienced in designing robust embedded systems solutions, integrating hardware and software, and working across platforms including ARM Cortex-M/A, TI C2000, PIC, and nRF52840.
    🔧 I’m currently exploring theoretical computer science topics like automata and information theory, aiming to bridge my electrical engineering background with deeper computer science knowledge.
    🤝 I’m open to collaborating on projects involving real-time control, signal processing, and embedded software design.
